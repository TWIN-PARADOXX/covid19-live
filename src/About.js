                            I belong to a family of single-stranded RNA viruses known as coronaviridae, a common type of virus which affects mammals, birds and reptiles.

                            In humans, corona virus commonly cause mild infections, similar to the common cold, and accounts for 10–30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults. More serious infections are rare, although I can cause enteric and neurological disease. The incubation period of mine varies but is generally up to two weeks.

                            The previous outbreaks include Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), identified in southern China in 2003. MERS infected around 2,500 people and led to more than 850 deaths while SARS infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths. The case fatality rates for these conditions were 35% and 10%, respectively.

                            I am a new strain of corona virus that has not been previously identified in humans. Although the incubation period of mine is currently unknown, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Chinese researchers have indicated that I may be infectious during my incubation period.

                            When humans contract a coronavirus, it typically happens due to contact with an infected animal.
                            Some of the most common carriers are bats, though they do not typically transmit coronaviruses directly to humans. Instead, the transmission might occur via an intermediary animal, which will usually, though not always, be a domestic one.

                            The SARS coronavirus spread to humans via civet cats, while the MERS virus spread via dromedaries. However, it can be difficult to determine the animal from which a coronavirus starts spreading among humans.
                            In the case of mine, initial reports from China tied the outbreak to a seafood market in central Wuhan. As a result, local authorities closed down the market on January 1, 2020.

                        </p>
                        <p className="about--content--item-text">
                            However, later assessments have suggested that this market was unlikely to be the single source of the outbreak, as some people with the virus early on had no connection with it.

                            Specialists have not yet been able to determine the true source of mine or even confirm whether there was a single original reservoir.
                            When MNT contacted the WHO for comment, their spokespeople emphasized:

                            According to WHO spokespeople, “Researchers are still studying the exact parameters of human-to-human transmission.”

                            “In Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak, some people became ill from exposure to a source, most likely an animal, carrying the disease. This has been followed by transmission between people,” they explained.

                        <p className="about--content--item-text">
                            “As with other coronaviruses, the transmission is through the respiratory route, meaning I am concentrated in the airways (nose and lungs) and can pass to another person via droplets from their nose or mouth, for example. They still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of this transmission and how people are infected.”

                        </p>
                        <p className="about--content--item-text">
                            The WHO state that “The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. It is, therefore, possible to catch me from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.”
                        </p>
                        <p className="about--content--item-text">
                            According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some recent studies suggest that people may still spread me if they are not showing symptoms.

                            This means that people should adopt careful hygiene practices and engage in physical distancing — even around people who do not appear to be sick.

                            The CDC also report that I spread easily among people. They state that I am spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.People may begin to experience symptoms 2–14 days after exposure.”

                            The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public places where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot (2-meter) distance from others. This will help slow the spread of me from asymptomatic people and people who do not know that they have contracted it. People should wear cloth face masks while continuing to practice physical distancing.
